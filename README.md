# web-scraping

Web Scraping is as simple as the data extraction from a website. I did a simple data extraction from http://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/page-1.html using library from Python named BeautifulSoup, you can check here https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ for the detail.
The data that I extract are:
1. Title
2. Price
3. Rating

As a result, I store the data in a dataframe, so it can be used easily for the information of price and rating each book.
